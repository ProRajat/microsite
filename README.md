# Microsite Template
This project uses the MediaSilo API and creates a basic screener application. Users are presented with a list of projects and assets that can be viewed in the browser. This project is intended as a starting-off point for a developer who wishes to build any variety of application using MediaSilo as the media management platform. 

For more information on the api, please see https://docs.mediasilo.com.

### About the SLIM Framework
This project uses the lightweight [Slim Framework](www.slimframework.com) for basic routing in PHP. You can use your mini-framework of choice; we like Slim because of its simplicity.

### Twig for Templating
This project also uses [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) as a lightweight templating language. There are only two pages in the templates directory: home.html and login.html.
